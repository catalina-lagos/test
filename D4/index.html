    <p>We are a group of researchers at the Technical University of Delft in The Netherlands. In this research project, we aim to investigate the effectiveness of a tool that allows people to elicit social position (e.g. gender, ability) and its effect their value preferences. As such, you are invited to participate in our research study.</p>
    <p>The following task is part of the research project described above. Upon accessing the web application, you will be first presented with a text that you should rate in terms of fairness. Next, you will be asked to unpack which facets of your social identity and position (e.g. gender, ability) may have lead to the fairness rating you provided.</p>
    <p> Completion of these tasks does not require any specific equipment or knowledge. Your participation in this task is entirely voluntary, and you can withdraw at any time without any adverse consequences.</p>
    <p>We will collect your fairness rating and your self-provided social identity and position data with the tool. Depending on your answers this may include: information about your age, gender, citizenship, race, class, ability, cis/trans, sexual orientation.</p>
    <p> We do not collect any data aside from the information described, and we will keep your information confidential to the best of our ability. All data is stored in a password-protected electronic format. Be aware that the data we gather with this task might be published in anonymized form later. Such an anonymized data set would include the answers you provide in this task but no personal information (e.g., your worker ID) so that the answers will not be traceable back to you.</p>
    <p>You can further contact the researchers for any clarification. Send an email to <strong>a.arzberger@tudelft.nl</strong>.</p>
    <p>By clicking “I consent” at the bottom of this page, you confirm that you have read, understood, and consent to the above information</p>
    <p>Note: You can exit the task at any time. This will imply revoking your consent, and subsequently, all your data will be discarded from our databases</p>
